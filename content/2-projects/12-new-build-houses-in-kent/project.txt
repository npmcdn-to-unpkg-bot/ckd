Title: New build houses in Kent

----

Year: 2013

Text: These small houses are designed for a very tight site, so we placed the outside space above  the cars, by providing car ports overlooked by the kitchens for security. The bridges connect the living rooms to the terraces at first floor, reflecting the local seafaring character of the nearby medway river.
