Title: Thames Penthouse

Year: 2015

Text: 

The addition of a terrace and a roof on top of a mansion block in a sensitive location. This provides space for a study overlooking the Thames and a sitting room opening on to a south facing terrace connecting to the original top floor flat.

Our priority was to provide maximum headroom with maximum natural light within the strict planning constraints, and to give a sense of space and light along with warmth, by using timber, both painted and natural oak, all the while expressing the steel structure.
