Title: Berkshire Manor House

Year: 2014

Text: Existing rear additions filling a walled garden are to be replaced with contemporary flat roof extensions following the original tudor courtyard layout. These rationalise the northern side of the building and allow the rear of the building and the tudor walls to be properly appreciated. The new extensions partly sit within the recreated walled garden designed to be a sun catcher, and straddle the tudor wall to provide family kitchen, dining, ancillary and TV rooms.
