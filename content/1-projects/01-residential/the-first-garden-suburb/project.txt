Title: The First Garden Suburb

----

Text: This is an example of a small design project that we do many of throughout the year.

The client asked us in this instance to advise on how a small lean-to with a kitchen at the back of their house could be improved.

By minimal works we amended the roof and created the sensation of a pavilion within the garden, bathed in sunlight throughout the year.

Although in a Conservation Area, the works all fell within permitted development without the need for planning approval. We introduced the client to a reliable contractor with whom we often work and they carried out the works direct to the client without the need for any extra involvement from ourselves, excepting for occasional clarification.
